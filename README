To get git to ignore emacs backups & autosaves
just make file in project folder called ".gitignore"
and add "*~" & "*#" on their own newline.
also add ".gitignore" to ingore the file itself :)

this is just a template I thought might work, no stress on filling this out unless everything turns out to be a mess :P, I know I won't bother too much, thinking that as long as the description at the top of each file is updated then its all chill.

To remove deleted files trom git tracking:
git ls-files --deleted | xargs git rm
